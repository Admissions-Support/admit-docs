# Session Types

Session types are only for ELC and are the actual sessions that the children will be attending. When you first view the page it shows a list of all the session types already set. To createa a session type just press the Add Sessin Type button and you are taken to a new page to create the session.

First you set the name and how many session are available per week. This is not how many days this session runs but how many sessions the child is eligible for per week and this number does not include additional sessions. There is also a toggle that sets the session type thats being created to additional session. These sessions are not main sessions but secondary sessions that can be added to main sessions.

After this section there is check marks to set the operating days of this session type and below the option to allow Any choices. Any choices are choices that parents make when they dont mind what day their child attends and instead of selecting certain days the system will make the decision instead to fit as many kids in as possible. Enabling this option doesnt force all parents to select Any but only leaves it as an option but parents will still be able to select certain days if they want to.

The next section you are able to enable split sessions on the session. These sessions are split between locations using the same session type and also are able to be set to allow additional sessions to split between different locations. Parents are able to select these but are not forced to select a split session if they dont want to if these are enabled.

The bottom section you are able to set Additional sessions on this session and set how many sessions of this additional session parents are able to select. Its possible to add multiple additional sessions but parents are only allowed to select one of the additional sessions.

Once a session type has been created it will show in the list of all sessions. If you require to edit anything that has been set on a session you are able to select it from the list and it opens a similar view to when creating the session. From here you are able to edit everything or even delete the session completely.
