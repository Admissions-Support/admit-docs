Week Models are where you set how many hours per week a child attends the nursery and these attach to the sessions that get created.

**Cohorts**

Cohorts are groups of children at various stages of education from a 2 year old at nursery all the way to Secondary School. When you first view the page you can see the list of all the different stages already in the system. To create a new one press Add Cohort button at the top of the screen and it takes you to a page to create a new cohort that only has a name field and a checkbox option. The check box option works with school years and means that kids that fit into this cohort can join not at the start of the school year but during the different intakes of the school year. If this cohort will join the school at the start of the school year and thats it then you dont need to check this check box (link to school year knowledge page).
