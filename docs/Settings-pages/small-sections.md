**Ratios**

Ratios are where we set the ratio of kids of a certain age to staff members required to look after them. When you first view the Ratio page it shows with a list of all the current ratios on the platform. To create a new ratio you press the Add Ratio button and it takes you to a new page to create the ratio. First you are able to give the ratio a name and set the age range of the children that relate to this ratio. When setting the age range you are able to set the age between months and years. The last thing you are able to do is set how many children can be looked after by a single staff member. After everything has been inputted you are able to press create and now its able to be seen in the list of all the ratios.
