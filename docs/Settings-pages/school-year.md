# School Year setup

**School Year**

When Setting up a school year you first need to give it a name and set the start and end dates. These dates will be whats set later on the page in the elegibility section.

**Cohorts**

Next you need to set which Cohorts that are in the school year and the date of birth ranges for them (they can overlap but when setting up there shouldnt be gaps of missing dates). For an ELC school year these will normally be 2 year old, Ante Pre school, Pre school and Defered. For a Primary and Secondary school year it will have Primary and Secondary cohorts.

**Eligibility**

This section is where you are able to set the intakes and set deadlines for these intakes and how cohorts relate to intakes. Inside the Cohorts page in settings (link to cohorts page) you are able to set them to say if the cohorts use intakes or if they are just set to the start of the school year. Every cohort that says it ses intakes shows up on every intake in this section apart from the default one.

If you are setting up a Primary or Secondary school year you dont need to add any intakes but with a ELC school year you will be adding a few of them. To create the first and subsiquent intakes you just need to press Add Intake button and then a section apears with empty date fields and the cohorts that use intakes also with date ranges. The date ranges at the top are for setting how long the intake lasts ie what part of the school year date range it covers and a deadline for the application to be allowed to be submitted by parents. Applications that are submitted after the deadline are still allowed to be submitted but will be marked in reports that they were submitted after the deadline.

The date fields in the cohorts show the range of children's birthdays that are eligibile for this intake that are in certain cohorts. There is also a checkmark and if this is checked it allows children whos birthday would be after the start date of the intake to join and reserve space in that intake but they wont start until after their birthday.
