### What is Admit?

Admit is a platform and service designed to support education departments within local authorities in the UK. Its main purpose is to digitise and streamline the management of school admissions, nursery placements, and potentially other childcare and education-related services.

It acts as a central hub where parents, nurseries, schools, and local authority administrators can interact efficiently. The platform supports applications, messaging, file uploads, notifications, and status tracking for education-related processes.

### Who can use this platform?
Parents and Carers can create an account and access their interface. Local authority staff access is invite only and permissions vary depending on their role and requirements.

### I can not see a section of the platform?
Local authority users should start by reviewing their permissions. Not all parts of the platform may be available to you. Access can be granted and revoked at any time, please review with your supervisors.
